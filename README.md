# Chit-Chat Readme

Program by Madeleine, Vee and Mads

Welcome to our chat program called Chit-Chat.

Description:


Wanna chat with people using a new tool? Then this is the tool for you.

How to Use:


The program currently only runs on a localhost.

Steps to start using the program:

-Start the server up (Server/Server.go)

-Start a client up (Client/client.go)

-Enter a username

-Chat whatever you want

When you wanna leave, just write Leave and the program will automatically disconnect you from the server.

When the last person has left the server, the server will initiate a shutdown.
